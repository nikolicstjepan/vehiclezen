# Vehiclezen server

## About architecture

This in backend for vehicle management project. It was built with Clean Architecture in mind. It is:

1. Independent of Frameworks. All express related stuff is contained in web folder and it is easy to replace it with another web server.
2. Testable. The business rules can be tested without the UI, Database, Web Server, or any other external element.
3. Independent of UI. The UI can change easily, without changing the rest of the system. A sample console app is displayed in `src/console` folder (more about that latter).
4. Independent of Database. You can swap out Mongo easily if you make changes to `src/data-access` folder.
5. Independent of any external agency. In fact your business rules (`user` and `vehicle` in this case) simply donâ€™t know anything at all about the outside world.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
